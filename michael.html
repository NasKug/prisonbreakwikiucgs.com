    <h1>Michael Scofield</h1>
    <p>Michael J. Scofield is one of two protagonists in Prison Break. When his older brother,<a href="lincoln.html">Lincoln Burrows</a>, was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit, Michael formed an elaborate plan to break him out of prison from the inside. He obtained a jail sentence by holding up a bank at gunpoint and was incarcerated in Fox River State Penitentiary with Lincoln.</p>
